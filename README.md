# maasIsa
Mobility information platform for Isa

## Plans

- An app to connect each health care institution's cars
    - Connect location info
    - Connect car info (spec; chassis width, passenger cap, etc.)
    - Centrally:
        - plan car allocation
        - navigate best route
        - receive booking

- Potentially:
    - Expand to allow online booking for the ride share service
    - Allow route planning using public transport + this service


I'll probs use microservice approach and use the OpenAPI implementation of MDS (Mobility Data Specification) available [here](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mds-openapi)
